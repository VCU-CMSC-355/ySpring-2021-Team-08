# *Your Project Description*
## *Short Project Description*
The directory structure in this GitHub is to allow the project to have all its resources self-contained.
Open Source software should not just be a repository of code.  There are a number of directories to help you and others that will 
follow in your foot steps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship program to keep track of your project and get
a better understanding of the problems you encountered during the developmemnt of this project.

_*To preserve the integrity of the Master branch, our group has elected to push each of our individually-coded modules to separate version branches named after the author. During integration testing, branches will be integrated one-by-one into the 'integrationTesting' branch. Once integration testing is complete, the fully-integrated and working result will be pushed to master.*_
