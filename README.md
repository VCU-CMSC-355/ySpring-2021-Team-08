# CMSC 355 - Spring 2021 - Team 08 - Windows Application
## *Short Project Description*

_*To preserve the integrity of the Master branch, our group has elected to push each of our individually-coded modules to separate version branches named after the author. During integration testing, branches will be integrated one-by-one into the ```integrationTesting``` branch. Once integration testing is complete, the fully-integrated and working result will be pushed to master.*_
